1. Structure of the Program:

The program structure includes the following components:

Tool Class: Represents a tool with properties like Type and Barcode.

ToolInventory Class: Generates random tool inventories.

ToolSearcher Class: Searches for specific items in the inventory using parallel processing.

Main Program (Program.cs): Orchestrates the execution, performs tests, measures time, and writes results to console.

2. Evaluation of Tasks:

Parallelizability: The problem of searching for specific items in the inventory can be parallelized since different threads can independently search different portions of the inventory.

Partitioning: Divide the inventory into chunks and assign each thread a separate chunk to search.

Communication: Minimal communication is needed between threads as they work independently on their assigned chunks.

Data Dependencies: No dependencies between the chunks being searched by different threads. Each thread operates on its chunk of data.

Synchronization: Synchronization is required when waiting for all threads to complete their tasks before combining the results.

Load Balancing: Uneven distribution of workload among threads might cause load balancing issues.


3. Test Results:

Average Execution Times:
2 Threads:
Average Time = (40 + 29 + 26 + 119 + 45) / 5 ≈ 51.8 ms (rounded to 1 decimal place)
3 Threads:
Average Time = (142 + 140 + 30 + 456 + 41) / 5 ≈ 161.8 ms (rounded to 1 decimal place)
4 Threads:
Average Time = (88 + 26 + 24 + 46 + 94) / 5 ≈ 55.6 ms (rounded to 1 decimal place)
6 Threads:
Average Time = (62 + 25 + 26 + 29 + 36) / 5 ≈ 35.6 ms (rounded to 1 decimal place)


Observations:
The average execution time for searching items with different thread counts varies.
Lower average times generally indicate better performance.
6 Threads seem to have the lowest average execution time among the tested thread counts, suggesting better efficiency in searching for the specified items.


Conclusion:
Based on these results, it seems that using 6 threads performs better in terms of average execution time for searching specific items in the inventory, followed by 2 threads. 

6 Threads: Generally showed better performance due to increased parallelism and efficient utilization of available cores.

2 Threads: While having lower overhead, it might not fully leverage the available resources, leading to moderate performance.

3 and 4 Threads: Fell in between, likely affected by a balance between resource utilization, overhead, and workload distribution.

The performance of parallelized tasks is a complex interplay of various factors, and the behavior can vary based on the specific implementation, hardware configuration, workload characteristics, and other environmental aspects
